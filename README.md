A website dedicated to the preservation and archival of Disney's Splash Mountain.

## Deprecation Notice

Unfortunately due to a lack of time and interest from the developers, Splash Mountain Legacy will not be receiving any updates beyond Release 1.4.0. The website will be kept online as long as possible, but no new features or bug fixes will be implemented.

On behalf of the entire development team, we'd like to thank the community for their support and continued interest in Splash Mountain Legacy. We hope you enjoyed the experience as much as we did!

## About the Project

Splash Mountain Legacy was created to provide an archive of Disney's Splash Mountain. Splash Mountain was a log flume ride that was featured in three of Disney's parks: Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, and Tokyo Disneyland. As of 2024, both the Disneyland and Magic Kingdom rides are closed. Splash Mountain Legacy hosts a plethora of images, videos, audio, and more from the rides.
